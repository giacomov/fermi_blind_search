    is given, divide the series in blocks where the difference with respect to
    the background is perceptibly constant.


    Args:
      tt (iterable): An iterable (list, numpy.array...) containing the arrival
                     time of the events.
                     NOTE: the input array MUST be time-ordered, and without
                     duplicated entries. To ensure this, you may execute the
                     following code:

                     tt_array = numpy.asarray(tt)
                     tt_array = numpy.unique(tt_array)

                     before running the algorithm.

      p0 (float): The probability of finding a variations (i.e., creating a new
                  block) when there is none. In other words, the probability of
                  a Type I error, i.e., rejecting the null-hypothesis when is
                  true. All found variations will have a post-trial significance
                  larger than p0.

      bkgIntegralDistr (function, optional): the integral distribution for the
                  background counts. It must be a function of the form f(x),
                  which must return the integral number of counts expected from
                  the background component between time 0 and x.
